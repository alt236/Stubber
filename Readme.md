Stubber
-----------

This app will make a stub copy of the code in a Jar file.

Pretty hastily written for an issue at hand.

To see how it works, have a look into `StubThis.java`

Known Limitations
-----------
* No annotation support
* Recursive references, like Android's [NoCopySpan.java](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/master/core/java/android/text/NoCopySpan.java), will make this blow.

Changelog
-----------
* v0.0.1 First public release
